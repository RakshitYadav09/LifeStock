# Quick Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. **QuickAddModal Not Working**
- **Problem**: QuickAddModal was just a placeholder with no functionality
- **Solution**: 
  - Added full CRUD functionality for tasks, events, lists, and friend requests
  - Integrated with collaboration context
  - Added proper error handling and loading states
  - Added sharing options for tasks, events, and lists

### 2. **Missing Task Sharing in CreateTask**
- **Problem**: No option to share tasks when creating them
- **Solution**:
  - Added `sharedWith` state and functionality
  - Added friend selection UI with checkboxes
  - Integrated with existing backend API that already supported task sharing
  - Added visual feedback for selected collaborators

### 3. **List Creation Should be Called "Lists" with Sharing Option**
- **Problem**: Page called "Shared Lists" was confusing and sharing wasn't prominent
- **Solution**:
  - Changed title from "Shared Lists" to "Lists"
  - Enhanced the sharing UI in list creation modal
  - Made sharing section more prominent with better visual design
  - Added explanatory text for users without friends

### 4. **Calendar Event Update Not Working/No Feedback**
- **Problem**: Calendar updates weren't showing success/error notifications
- **Solution**:
  - Added local notification system to CalendarPage
  - Shows success notifications for event creation/updates
  - Shows error notifications for failures
  - Auto-dismiss notifications after 5 seconds
  - Proper error handling with descriptive messages

### 5. **removeNotification Function Error**
- **Problem**: `removeNotification is not a function` error in NotificationToast
- **Solution**: 
  - This was already fixed in previous iterations
  - The NotificationContainer correctly receives `removeNotification` prop
  - `handleDeleteNotification` is properly destructured from collaboration context
